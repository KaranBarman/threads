## UserCard Component

The `UserCard` component is a reusable React component that displays information about a user. It takes the following props:

- `name`: The user's name.
- `id`: The user's unique identifier.
- `username`: The user's username.
- `imgUrl`: The URL to the user's profile picture.
- `personType`: The type of person the user is (e.g., "student", "teacher", "admin").

The component uses the `Image` component from the `next/image` library to display the user's profile picture. The `Image` component takes the following props:

- `src`: The URL to the image.
- `alt`: The alternative text for the image.
- `width`: The width of the image in pixels.
- `height`: The height of the image in pixels.
- `className`: The CSS class names to apply to the image.

The `UserCard` component also uses the `Button` component from the `ui/button` module. The `Button` component takes the following props:

- `onClick`: The function to call when the button is clicked.
- `className`: The CSS class names to apply to the button.

The `UserCard` component uses the `useRouter` hook from the `next/navigation` library to navigate to the user's profile page when the "View" button is clicked. The `useRouter` hook returns an object with a `push` method that can be used to navigate to a new page.

The `UserCard` component is implemented as follows:

```typescriptreact
import Image from "next/image";
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "../ui/button";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

interface Props {
  name: string;
  id: string;
  username: string;
  imgUrl: string;
  personType: string;
}

const UserCard = ({ name, id, username, imgUrl, personType }: Props) => {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <article className="user-card text-light-1">
      <div className="user-card_avatar">
        <Image
          src={imgUrl}
          alt="logo"
          width={48
